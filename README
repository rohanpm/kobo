========================

------------

Django 1.5 update
-----------------
Django part of kobo was udpated to be compatible with 1.5 release. Lower
version are no more supported. As a side-effect, only python 2.6+ is
supported by django part.

From same reason there will be no builds of kobo-django package for RHEL 5
and lower as it lacks required python version.

- RemoteUserMiddleware is now used for KrbV authentication
- LimitedRemoreUserMiddleware can be used to authenticate only on entry
pages.
- LongnameUser model is used for auth backend. It allows 255 characters long
user names (as they come from KrbV)
- Class-based generic views ExtraListView and ExtraDetailView. object_list
helper stays for compatibility, but it is deprecated now and will be removed
in future.

Configuration handling in kobo.client and kobo.worker
-----------------------------------------------------
Configuration no longer uses os.environ to get config file path.

    conf.load_from_file(config_file)
    ... and pass conf to ClientCommandContainer, HubProxy or TaskManager


Configuration passed to tasks
-----------------------------
TaskBase constructor has now a mandatory argument 'conf', which is automatically set in TaskManager.
